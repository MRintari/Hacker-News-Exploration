# Hacker-News-Exploration
Hacker News have specific posts that begin with 'Ask HN' or 'Show HN'. 'Ask HN' refers to a post in which a user asks the community a specific question. 'Show HN' refers to a post in which a user intends to show the community a project, product or something of interest.

The goal for this project is to determine the following:

Do 'Ask HN', 'Show HN' or Other posts receive more comments and points on average?
Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments and points on average?
Overall, what is best to post and when should it be posted?
