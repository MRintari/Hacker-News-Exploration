    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this project, we analysed posts to determine which type of post and time receive the most comments and points on average. Based on the analysis, to maximize the amount of comments a post receives, it is recommended the post is categorised as an Ask HN post and created between 15:00 - 16:00 EST (20:00 - 21:00 BST). However, for all posts, it is best to post between 11:00 - 14:00 EST (16:00 - 19:00 BST). \n",
    "\n",
    "This time interval stays true for generating points, therefore it can be said that of the posts that received comments, posting between the hours of 11:00 EST and 14:00 EST, maximizes the number of comments and points a post can receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time interval being true for both comments and points suggests that these times may be when users are most active on Hacker News. Data on the number of users active at each hour of the day is not available, however this would be worth investigating to discover if this is the case or not. "
